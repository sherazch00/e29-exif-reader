# e29-exif-reader
CSCI E-29 Final Project (Image EXIF Analyzer)

Digital images have hidden information containing the all camera settings used to capture the image (the EXIF). 

Given a directory, this project aims to scan the directory and read this EXIF data for every image found.  Using pandas, 
I will manipulate this data to extract relevant features.

My images contain some subject information in the file names and I will use this label information to train a model using 
the features generated from the EXIF data.  Letâ€™s see if we can find a cute baby!
